# splunk-ds-usf-analytics
Repository that holds my Exploratory Analysis and Feature Engineering code for the Mission To Mars AWS Contest.

## Background Information

During my senior year at Univeristy of South Florida, I was a member of the USF Data Science Club. The project for that club year was to partake in the AWS Mission To Mars Contest (which was unfortunately cancelled due to COVID). We decided to continue with the challenge and succesfully present our findings to the USF executive board.

## Project Explanation

* **Dataset**: AWS Cloudtrail Network Logs from Splunk
* **Goal**: Create a ML Model that can accurately predict wether an IP address trying to access a Cloudtrail Instance is an attacker or not.
* **Role**: Data Engineer/Analyst

There are three files in this repository. They house my own original data analysis and engineering that was done for the project. 

Please feel free to read through them and use any part of the code for your own work!
